# AssemblyMultiplication
A bootable calculator written in ASM

### What is it? ###
A basic multiplication calculator written in assembly.
The actual multiplication doesn't occupy more than 10% of the lines
Most of the lines are about processing the user input and converting
the product to a readable format. Multiplication is performed by 
making an addition loop.

### Booting ###
It is bootable, so it can be compiled with NASM to get a .bin
to be written to a USB.
